# renders not working
an error code might be 503 or 404. below is a solution.
note: this is pretty rare or common or idk. it happens on main machines (your desktop). point is, you should use a vps

1. change your gs url to 127.0.0.1:8080 if the main one is already being used.
2. close any interferring applications such as steam and any webhosting applications or whatever
3. that should all work idk
